## Before You Begin Your Final Exam

### Things to Remember

Using unambiguous copyright and license notices in the code helps you avoid problems with its adoption:

* For new files - Add a copyright statement and indicate the license the file is governed by in a file notice.
* For significant changes in existing files - Update the copyright if appropriate and, if relevant, any other licenses.
* Always secure all the necessary permissions before contributing changes to upstream projects, and understand the mechanisms used for contributions.

The material to date (updated March 2020) has summarized the basics of how a file notice is formed (from a copyright statement and an unambiguous reference to the license in effect), when a copyright notice should be updated, as well as what mechanisms are used, and what permissions may need to be secured, when submitting changes to upstream projects.
